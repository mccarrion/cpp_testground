# cpp_testground
This repository is a coding journal of my time learning the features and best practices of the C++ programming language.
Various notes and coding sections will be added over time. This repository will also contain code from various tutorials
that have been completed. Please refer to tutorials section for more information.

Sometimes there might be code or references to C, Rust, Fortran, etc.

## Sections
* algorithms - This area has Computer Science related things I am learning. The plan is that any Algorithm in the 
algorithms section that gets committed to version control will in fact be my own implementation of that Algorithm.
* projects - These are random projects that I have thrown together. They will be derived from what I am capable of doing
in C++ without guidance.
* tutorials - This is __not__ my code. This contains code from tutorials I have worked through. I might save the code 
from the most recent tutorial and then keep a doc tracking all of the tutorials I have been through. Will rank and 
review tutorials based on how good they are.
