# Algorithms

This area contains computer science things I am learning or interested in. The first algorithm is of course, a string 
reversal algorithm. I knew the choice would be either FizzBuzz or String Reversal, so I went with string reversal. The 
implementation is very Java-like since that is the language I work in most of the time currently. My understanding of 
pointers is limited and it seems that my understanding of pointers will need to improve in order to write more idiomatic
C++ code.
