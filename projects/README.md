# Projects
 
This is where I store my personal projects. The current project is ConsoleApplication1 - this is a basic command line 
application. First thing is to try to build a basic calculator and maybe a magic 8-ball game.

## Notes

This section has random C++ standards and interesting things I found while learning how to make cool programs with C++.
